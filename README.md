How to run
In this CSV there are two files of code titled part_1_mars_news and part_2_mars_weather. There is also
a CSV titled Mars_weather. 
In order to run this code first run part_1 and then once you run the final cell to close the browser,
run part_2. All of the visualizations are stored in this file as well as my analysis and the code
to answer the questions for the homework. At the end of the jupyter notebook there is a line of code
to generate the CSV titled Mars_weather.

In order to create this code my tutor Lucas helped me fix code for scraping the data and creating the pandas dataframe.
He also helped my with the syntax for changing terrestrial date column into a date_time variable. He also helped with
formatting and editing the code for the visualizations.
